# car-maintenance-records
Program for keeping track of car maintenance records

## Description
This project is full stack and uses a ASP.NET Core API service connected to a MS SQL database. The front end was created with Vue.js and uses a mix of custom and Bootstrap CSS.

This app can be used to store and add records for maintenance work done on a personal vehicle. As a user of the app, I can see what work I have done on my vehicle and add records as I complete work.

## Future Ideas
The app can be easily converted to showing records for multiple vehicles.
The app has no authentication for users currently and may benifit from it in the future.
How would this work as a native app on a phone?
Can this service be connected to any other services? 
Easy submit buttons can be added for regular maintenance activities like changing oil.
Can the user scan their dashboard to get a reading on the mileage instead of typing it in?
